description: >-
    This is Ethereal, my latest, greatest, and quite possibly most unique template for HTML5 UP.<br/><br/> Since releasing Parallelism 3-4 years ago (!!!), I've been dying to do another side-scrolling template with more in the way of flexibility/customization potential.<br/><br/> The result is this template, Ethereal, which combines a robust side-scrolling framework of my own creation (with various "scroll-assist" features like drag/momentum scrolling, keyboard shortcuts, etc.) with a unique look and feel, a lightbox gallery, tons of customization options, and, of course, full responsiveness. Hope you dig it :)
